# HLA-B Leader Usage

A Jupyter notebook is available here as a demonstration of how to use the HLA-B Leader service for annotating your HLA datasets.

For this example, a local HLA-B Leader REST server needs to be active. Instructions for initiating one can be found [here](../README.md#b-leader-rest-service-). Leave the resulting terminal active and open a new one to continue the steps below.

To get started, ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed. For new users, follow these [instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to install a suite of Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other relevant packages.

Once installed, the following command should work. Please use it to instantiate the example notebook.
```
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `hla_b_leader_example.ipynb` notebook to start running through the examples.

Information and code exist side-by-side in the notebook for demonstrating HLA-B Leader Service usage.

To go step by step, you can press shift + enter. To run the whole notebook, open the `Cell` menu and select `Run All`.

Outputs will render as code chunks are executed.

Feel free to reuse any code snippets for your own usage!
